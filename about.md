Welcome! I'm Elaine, from Guangzhou. I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo's Computational Mathematics program. I am particularly interested in Data Science and Natural Language Processing, and recently completed a project where I performed in-depth sentiment classification on Chinese text messages. In my free time, I like to travel, learn kpop dance, and play board games, especially chess.
